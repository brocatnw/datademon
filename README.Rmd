## Thanks
Not all of these tools originated from me. Many have been stolen with pride and modified. 
Special thanks to Bob Rudis for his work with the hrbrthemes package which helped me create all of my themes.
Additional thanks to Karl Broman for some of his tools.
And of course to RStudio for making the tools easier and easier to use.
